Knowing how to develop a working product is only half the journey. Protecting it from breaking, for whatever reason, is the other half. That "*whatever reason*" is what I've spent years studying and mastering to be able to avoid problems where possible or, otherwise, diagnose and repair when external factors play their part.

Some products are often developed like a tower of jenga after everyone else has already had a turn. The only block available to you doesn't just have a chance of bringing the tower tumbling down but you know it's absolutely going to.

No digital product should be developed so fragile. Your website speaks your message. Your app serves your customers. Truly, your digital product can either turn visitors into customers or have them running away to your competitors. You can't be wasting time with a wobbly tower.
