When you come up to a traffic light and bring the car to a halt, sometimes the car in the next lane decides to crawl a bit. For a moment, you wonder if that car is moving forward or you're rolling backwards. You push a little harder on the brakes. Just to ease your mind, you look at a tree in the distance to make sure that you are not moving in relation to it.

Can you imagine how unsettling it would be if that tree started moving too?

With ever-changing laws and regulations, scammers and hackers constantly changing their methods of attack, software demands and requirements shifting with the wind, it can often feel as though the metaphorical tree is moving in technology. In an industry that changes so often, how can **RAVENCI** promise reliability?
